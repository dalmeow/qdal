**Data analysis** is anything that relates to analysing data, whether you collected it yourself or you used pre-existing data.

There are two main approaches to data analysis:

-   **Quantitative data analysis** is about learning from measured data. Data can be operationalised in many different ways and these determine the type of analyses you can apply.

-   **Qualitative data analysis** is about learning from the features and characteristics of the data.

Note that while it is common to talk about "quantitative vs qualitative *data*" in fact in most cases data can be conceived as both quantitative *and* qualitative. It is really how we approach the data that can be quantitative and/or qualitative. Moreover, these two approaches to data analysis are not necessarily opposite to each other and there are some aspects of each in each other. This will become clearer at the end of the course this textbook is written for.

This textbook focuses on quantitative data analysis. The rest of this chapter introduces fundamental concepts of quantitative methods.

## Quantitative data analysis

Quantitative analyses are usually comprised of three parts (these are not strictly distinct and the boundaries are sometimes blurred):

-   Summarise data with summary measures.

-   Visualise data with plots.

-   Model data with statistical models.

**Summary measures** are numbers that represent certain properties of the data: common summary measures are the mean and the standard deviation. You will have frequently seen these in published paper, either in text or as a table. You will learn about summary measures in @sec-summaries.

**Plots**, or graphs, are another common way to summarise data but they are based on visual representation rather than single numbers. As the saying goes, "[a picture is worth a thousand words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_picture_is_worth_a_thousand_words)". The aim of plots is to make explicit certain patterns in the data. Choosing and designing plots that are effective and captivating is more of an art and you will learn the basics and heuristics of good (and bad plots) in @sec-viz.

**Statistical models** are mathematical representations of patterns and relationship in data. Statistical modelling is a powerful tool to learn from the data or to assess research hypotheses. This textbook introduces you to a specific type of statistical models: regression models. These are highly flexible model that can be used with a variety of data types. You will start learning about statistical models in @sec-reg-intro.

## Numbers have no meaning

As mentioned earlier, both qualitative and quantitative approaches are valid and necessary to improve our understanding of things. Moreover, even a very complex quantitative analysis will always contain some qualitative aspects.

The numbers have no way of speaking for themselves. We speak for them. We imbue them with meaning.

There's a lot of wisdom in that quote. Numbers do not mean anything by themselves. We need to interpret numbers, "imbue them with meaning", based on many aspects of research and beyond, including our own identity and positionality [@jafar2018; @darwinholmes2020].
