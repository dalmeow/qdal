# Research Methods {#sec-res-meth}

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Area-Research_methods-blue)

[Research Methods]{.smallcaps} are about the theory, methods and practice of conducting research. I like to call the discipline that deals with research methods [Hodotics]{.smallcaps}, but it hasn't caught on yet.

One way of categorising different aspects of research methods is represented in the following figure.

![](img/res-methods-2.png){fig-align="center"}

You can think of **research methods** as the combination of:

-   The **research process**: the process of conducting a research project, from determining the research context to communicating results.

-   **Project management**: the process of managing a research project, from project planning to writing-up.

-   **Digital skills**: all research involves using computers (at least at some point if not throughout) so that computer literacy and digital skills are nowadays a fundamental aspect of research.

-   **Philosophy**: all research is not performed in a vacuum and a lot of philosophical questions shape the entire research process.

-   **Ethics**: all research is not performed in a social vacuum and ethical considerations are a fundamental aspect of research.

Let's zoom in on the [research process]{.smallcaps}.

![](img/res-process.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **Context**: the research context includes several aspects of the research process, including the background (i.e. the previous literature and current knowledge) and the rational of the study (from the general topic to specific research questions/hypotheses).

-   **Data acquisition**: this is the process of gathering data to be used in the study. Data acquisition covers many different types of processes, from experimental set-ups to corpus queries.

-   **Data analysis** is the process of analysing the acquired data using qualitative, quantitative or a mixed methods. This part of the research process also include interpreting the output of such analysis.

-   **Communication**: finally, the last step in a research process cycle is to communicate what was done and what was learned, both to the research community and to the wider public.

## Empirical research

**Empirical research** is one approach to research. This type of research focusses on learning about the Universe through data and observation.

### Empirical research

The word *empirical* is related to *experience*, and in the context of research it basically means "based on experience (i.e. data and observation)".

Lear more about the etymology of *empirical* [here](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/empirical#Etymology).

## Axes of research

![](img/axes-research.png)

There are two main "axes" of empirical research types:

-   Exploratory vs corroboratory.

-   Descriptive vs explanatory.

::: callout-note
### Exploratory vs corroboratory research

-   **Exploratory research** is about exploring the data looking for patterns, associations, features and so on. This type of research is also known as "hypothesis generating" because exploration can lead to the formulation of new hypotheses.

-   **Corroboratory research** (aka as confirmatory research) is about checking expectations against data. It is also known as "hypothesis testing" because it is about testing hypotheses using data.
:::

While there is still a lot of prejudice against exploratory research (typical sentiments are "it doesn't have theory") it is an important way of doing research, as recognised by important scholars like Tukey. In [*We need both Exploratory and Confirmatory*](https://www.doi.org/10.2307/2682991), Tukey stressed the importance of both approaches to research.

::: callout-note
### Descriptive vs explanatory research

-   **Descriptive research** is about *describing* facts through observation and collection of data. In other words, descriptive research is about the *what*.

-   **Explanatory research** is about *explaining* facts, i.e. understanding why they are the way they are. In other words, explanatory research is about the *why*.
:::

## Research objectives

There can be three types of **research objectives**. Each has its merits and to improve our understanding of the Universe we need all three, although there is nothing wrong for any one study to focus just on one or two!

::: callout-tip
### Establish facts

**Research can establish facts and fill a gap in the knowledge of one or more phenomena.**

The aim of establishing facts is to accumulate evidence of particular events, features, associations.

Examples:

-   What are the uses of the Sanskrit verb *gam* 'to go'?
-   What is the duration of vowels in Mawayana (Arawakan)?
-   Do people interact with AI as with other people?

### Improve fit of framework to facts

**Research can improve the fit of a specific framework to established facts.** Usually this is done to fine-tune a framework in light of new evidence but it also just works when you want to test new expectations/hypotheses. When the facts do not match the expectations, researchers modify the framework to accommodate the results.

In some cases, a framework can be totally abandoned in light of the facts, or a new one could be developed.

Examples:

-   Strong exemplar-based models preclude the possibility of abstract representations, but certain categorisation tasks seem to involve abstract representations so these must be included in exemplar-based models.
:::

::: callout-important
### Compare fit of different frameworks to facts

**This objective allows researcher two compare two or more frameworks in light of empirical results.** The main prerequisite for this approach is that each framework must have different expectations in relation to the phenomenon at hand.

When different frameworks entail different and exclusive hypotheses, one can test the hypotheses with data: the results might help excluding certain hypotheses and keep others. The frameworks that generate the excluded hypotheses have to be abandoned (unless they can be modified to fit the new results, see above, while still be different enough from other frameworks).

Examples:

-   There are two possible models for the bilingual lexicon: Word association and concept mediation. Which one better describes and explains the data?
-   A strict feed-forward architecture of grammar does not allow phonetic details to be sensitive to morphological structure, while some exemplar-based models allow that.
:::

Each of the three objectives are important in research, but note that in order to really advance our understanding of things the third objective is fundamental: it is only by directly comparing different frameworks that we can accumulate knowledge and weed out inaccurate explanations.

## Research context {#sec-res-context}

@ellis2008 introduce a nice break-down of the concept of "research context".

The image below is a schematic representation of different aspects of the research context, from the most general to the most specific. An example of each is also provided.

![](img/research-topic.png)

### Research questions

Research questions are **testable questions** whose answers directly address the problem.

They take the form of actual *questions*:

-   What is the average speech rate of adolescents vs that of older adults?
-   What happens to infants syntactic processing when they move from a monolingual to a multilingual environment?
-   Is the morphological complexity of languages spoken by larger populations different from that of languages spoken by smaller populations?

Research questions are always necessary, independent of the type and objective of the research.

While there is an undue pressure on researcher to come up with "novel" research questions all the time, it is perfectly fine to ask the same question multiple times.

### Research hypotheses

Research hypotheses are **statements** (not questions) about the research problem.

Hypotheses must be **falsifiable** (there can be in principle an outcome that shows them to be false). See below.

Hypotheses **are never true nor confirmed**. We can only **corroborate** hypothesis, and it's a long term process. The same hypothesis has to be tested again and again, but multiple researchers in multiple contexts.

Research is not a one-off matter: knowledge can only be acquired slowly and with a lot of effort.

It is however perfectly fine to run a study with only research questions, without a research hypothesis. As long as you clearly state whether you are talking about research *questions* or research *hypotheses*, you are fine.

### Falsifiability

You might be wondering what it is meant by "falsifiable" statements. From [Seven examples of falsifiability](https://simplicable.com/new/falsifiability) by John Spacey:

> A statement is falsifiable if it can be contradicted by an observation. If such observation is impossible to make with current technology, falsifiability is not achieved.

Some examples of falsifiable hypotheses:

-   "Life only exists on Earth." (it would be falsified by the observation of life somewhere else).
-   "If there is a 1st person exclusive dual, then there is also a 1st person inclusive dual." [\[Universal 1871\]](https://typo.uni-konstanz.de/rara/universals-archive/1876/) (it would be falsified by the observation of languages with a 1st person exclusive dual but without the incluve alternative).
-   "Infants start uttering full sentences only after their 12th month of life." (it would be falsified by the observation of infants uttering full sentences before their 12th month of life).

And some examples of non-falsifiable hypotheses.

-   "Life might exist outside of the Solar system." (if we observe life outside the Solar system or we don't, the statement is still true).
-   "Languages with a 1st person inclusive dual can have a 1st person exclusive dual." (whether we observe a language with both 1st inclusive and exclusive dual or not, the statement is still true.)
