We have a question about something. Let's imagine that this something is the population of British Sign Language signers. We want to know whether the cultural background of the BSL signers is linked to different pragmatic uses of the sign for BROTHER. But we *can't survey the entire population* of BSL signers.[^ch-inference-1]\n\n[^ch-inference-1]: NOTE: *Population* can be a set of anything, not just a specific group of people. For example, the words in a dictionary can be a \"population\"; or the antipassive constructions of Austronesian languages...\n\nSo instead of surveying *all* BSL users, we take a **sample** from the BSL population. The sample is our data (the product of our study or observation). Now, how do we go from data/observation to answering our question about the use of BROTHER? We can use the inference process!\n\n::: callout-note\n#### Inference process\n\n**Inference** is the process of understanding something about a population based on the sample (aka the data) taken from that population.\n:::\n\nThe figure below is a schematic representation of the inference process.\n\n![](img/inference.png)\n\nXXX\n\nHowever, inference, despite being based on data, does not guarantee that the answers to our questions are right or even that they are true. In fact, any observation we make comes with a certain degree of **uncertainty and variability**.\n\n::: callout-note\n### Quiz 1\n\n**True or false?** \n\na. Inference is not needed if you gather data from the entire population. <select class='webex-select'><option value='blank'></option><option value='answer'>TRUE</option><option value=''>FALSE</option></select> \n\nb.

He certainly did not expect to die then. Leaving dark irony aside, as researchers we have to deal with uncertainty and variability:\n\n-   **Uncertainty** is about each observation of a phenomenon due to measurement error or because we cannot directly measure what we want to measure.\n\n-   **Variability** is found among different observations of the same phenomenon due natural fluctuations and measurement error.\n\nSo uncertainty is a feature of each mesurement, while variability occurs between different measurements. Together, uncertainty and variability render the inference process more complex and can interfere with its outcomes.\n\nThe following picture is a reconstruction of what Galileo Galilei saw when he pointed one of his first telescopes towards Saturn, based on his 1610 sketch: a blurry circle flanked by two smaller blurry circles.\n\n![](img/uncertainty.png)\n\nOnly six years later, telescopes were much better and Galileo could correctly identify that the flaking circles were not spheres orbiting around Saturn, but rings.\n\nThe moral of the story is that at any point in history we are like Galileo in at least some of our research: we might be close to understanding something but not quite there yet. So what do we do with such uncertainty and variability? We can use statistics to quantify them! **Statistics is a tool that helps us quantifying uncertainty and controlling for variability.** But what is statistics exacly?\n\n## What is statistics?\n\nStatistics is a **tool**. But what does it do? There are at least four ways of looking at statistics as a tool.\n\n-   Statistics is the **science** concerned with developing and studying methods for collecting, analyzing, interpreting and presenting empirical data. (From [UCI Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.uci.edu/what-is-statistics/))\n\n-   Statistics is the **technology** of extracting information, illumination and understanding from data, often in the face of uncertainty. (From the [British Academy](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/blog/what-is-statistics/))\n\n-   Statistics is a **mathematical and conceptual** discipline that focuses on the relation between data and hypotheses. (From the [Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/statistics/))\n\n-   Statistics is the **art** of applying the science of scientific methods. (From [ORI Results](https://www.oriresults.com/articles/blog-posts/the-art-of-statistics/), [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00898-0))\n\nTo quote a statistician:\n\n> *Statistic is both a science and an art*.\n>\n> It is a *science* in that its methods are basically systematic and have general application and an *art* in that their successful application depends, to a considerable degree, on the skill and special experience of the statistician, and on his knowledge of the field of application.\n\n—L. H. C. Tippett\n\n::: {.callout-important collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Extra\n\nCheck out the etymology of *statistics* here: <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/statistics#Etymology_1>.\n:::\n\n## What statistics is NOT\n\nStatistics is a many things, but it is also *not* a lot of things.\n\n-   Statistics is **not maths**, but it is informed by maths.\n\n-   Statistics is **not about hard truths** not how to seek the truth.\n\n-   Statistics is **not a purely objective** endeavour. In fact there are a *lot* of subjective aspects to statistics (see below).\n\n-   Statistics is **not a substitute** of common sense and expert knowledge.\n\n-   Statistics is **not just** about $p$-values and significance testing.\n\nAs Gollum would put it, *all that glisters is not gold*.\n\n![](img/gollum-statistician.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"300\"}\n\n## Many Analysts, One Data Set: subjectivity exposed\n\n![](img/red-card.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"250\"}\n\nIn @silberzahn2018, a group of researchers asked 29 independent analysis teams to answer the following question based on provided data: **Is there a link between player skin tone and number of red cards in soccer?**\n\nCrucially,\n\n-   **69%** of the teams reported an effect of player skin tone, and **31%** did not.\n\n-   In total, the 29 teams came up with **21 unique** types of statistical analysis.\n\nThese results clearly show how subjective statistics is and how even a straightforward question can lead to a multitude of answers.\n\nTo put it in Silberzah et al's words:\n\n> The observed results from analyzing a complex data set can be highly contingent on **justifiable**, but **subjective**, analytic decisions.\n\nThis is why you should always be somewhat **sceptical of the results of any single study**: you never know what results might have been found if another research team did the study. This is a reason for why replicating research is very important.\n\n<!-- TODO: add link to repro/repli -->\n\n@coretta2023 tried something similar, but in the context of the speech sciences: they asked 30 independent analysis teams (84 signed up, 46 submitted an analysis, 30 submitted usable analyses) to answer the question **Do speakers acoustically modify utterances to signal atypical word combinations?**\n\nIncredibly, the 30 teams submitted:\n\n-   **109** individual analyses. A bit more than 3 analyses per team!\n-   **52** unique measurement specifications and **47** unique model specifications.\n\n> Nine teams out of the thirty (30%) reported to have found at least one statistically reliable effect (based on the inferential criteria they specified). Of the 170 critical model coefficients, 37 were claimed to show a statistically reliable effect (21.8%).\n\n—Coretta et al, 2023\n\n![](img/forking-paths.png){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"300\"}\n\n## The \"New Statistics\"\n\nThe @silberzahn2018 and @coretta2023 studies are just the tip of the iceberg. We are currently facing a \"research crisis\".\n\n<!-- Add link to research crises -->\n\n@cumming2013 proposes a new approach to statistics, which he calls the \"New Statistics\", in response to the research crisis.\n\nThe New Statistics mainly addresses **three problems**:\n\n-   Published research is a biased selection of all (existing and possible) research.\n\n-   Data analysis and reporting are often selective and biased.\n\n-   In many research fields, studies are rarely replicated, so false conclusions persist.\n\nTo help solve those problems, it proposes **these solutions** (among others):\n\n-   Promoting **research integrity**.\n\n-   Shifting away from statistical significance to **estimation**.\n\n-   Building a **cumulative** quantitative discipline.\n\n## The Bayesian New Statistics\n\n@kruschke2018 revisit the New Statistics and make a further proposal: to adopt the historically older but only recently popularised approach of Bayesian statistics. They call this the Bayesian New Statistics.\n\nThe classical approach to statistics is the **frequentist method**, based on work by Fisher, and Neyman and Pearson. Frequentist statistics is based on rejecting the \"null hypothesis\" (i.e. the hypothesis that there is no difference between groups) using *p*-values.\n\n**Bayesian statistics** provides researchers with more appropriate and more robust ways to answer research questions, by reallocation of belief/credibility across possibilities.\n\nYou will learn more about the frequentist and the Bayesian approaches in @sec-freq-bayes.\n",
