This chapter introduces you to basic principles of good data visualisation, while in @sec-plotting you will learn the basics of plotting data in R.\n\n## Good data visualisation\n\nAlberto Cairo has identified four common features of good data visualisation ([Spiegelhalter 2019](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/294857/the-art-of-statistics-by-spiegelhalter-david/9780241258767): 64-66):\n\n::: callout-tip\n### Good data visualisation\n\n1.  It contains **reliable information**.\n\n2.  The design has been chosen so that relevant **patterns become noticeable**.\n\n3.  It is presented in an **attractive** manner, but appearance should not get in the way of **honesty, clarity and depth**.\n\n4.  When appropriate, it is organized in a way that **enables some exploration**.\n:::\n\nLet's see a few examples that illustrate each point. Since you will learn about the plotting code in the next chapter, the code is not shown by default here, but you can see it by clicking on the expandable `Code` button above each plot.\n\n\n\n## Information is (not) reliable\n\nLet's use the `coretta2022/glot_status` data. to create the plots because you will learn about it later. The following plot is titled *Number of endangered languages by macroarea and status*, but the plot contains both endangered and non-endangered languages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nglot_status %>%\n  # filter(status != \"extinct\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(Macroarea, fill = status)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"seq\", palette = \"BuPu\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of endangered languages by macroarea and status\",\n    caption = \"Stacked bar-chart\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ch-viz-principles_files/figure-html/status-bar-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can fix that by filtering the data so that it contains only endangered languages.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nglot_status %>%\n  filter(status != \"extinct\") %>%\n  ggplot(aes(Macroarea, fill = status)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"seq\", palette = \"BuPu\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Number of endangered languages by macroarea and status\",\n    caption = \"Stacked bar-chart\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ch-viz-principles_files/figure-html/status-bar-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Patterns are (not) noticeable\n\nThe `coretta2021/albvot` data contains data on VOT in Albanian. It has data from 6 speakers [@coretta2022]. The following plot uses a bar chart to show the VOT of different stops, but what you can't really see is that there is a lot of variability within and among stops and within and among speakers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nalbvot %>%\n  filter(consonant %in% c(\"p\", \"t\", \"k\", \"b\", \"d\", \"É¡\")) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(vot, consonant)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Albanian Voice Onset Time\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ch-viz-principles_files/figure-html/alb-vot-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can do better. The following plot shows individual measurements of VOT for different stops and speakers. Now an interesting pattern emerges: speaker 5 (`s05`) has particularly long VOT for /t/ and /k/ relative to the other speakers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\nalbvot %>%\n  filter(consonant %in% c(\"p\", \"t\", \"k\", \"b\", \"d\", \"\\u261\")) %>%\n  mutate(consonant = factor(consonant, levels = rev(c(\"p\", \"t\", \"k\", \"b\", \"d\", \"\\u261\")))) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(consonant, vot, colour = speaker)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = interaction(speaker, consonant)), position = position_dodge(width = 0.5)) +\n  geom_point(size = 1.5, alpha = 0.9, position = position_dodge(width = 0.5), aes(group = speaker)) +\n  geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-200, 200, by = 50)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    ttile = \"Albanian Voice Onset Time\",\n    y = \"Voice Onset Time (ms)\", x = \"Consonant\",\n    caption = \"Time 0 corresponds to the plosive release.\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ch-viz-principles_files/figure-html/alb-vot-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBar charts are unfortunately overused in research, even in those cases when they are not appropriate.\n\n## Aesthetics (should not) get in the way\n\n[![](/img/Speaking-the-world.jpg){fig-align=\"center\" width=\"400\"}](https://flowingdata.com/2013/07/15/open-thread-what-is-wrong-with-these-charts/)\n\nThe graph above has a lot of issues:\n\n1.  The bar length and thickness are not proportional. Compare Japanese with 123 million speakers vs English with 765 million speakers.\n2.  The graph mixes two scales: million speakers and billion speakers. This makes it look as if Chinese does not have that many more speakers.\n3.  The shade of orange of the bars does not seem to become proportionally darker with more speakers. Look at Arabic and Hindi: they have a very similar number of speakers but one bar is darker than the other.\n4.  The three dudes speaking are just fillers. Are they really necessary? Also, they are all white men...\n\nCan you find other issues? See more examples on [Ugly Charts](https://flowingdata.com/category/visualization/ugly-visualization/).\n\n## (Does not) enable exploration\n\nThe plot below shows the number of gestures enacted by infants of English, Bengali and Chinese background as recorded during a controlled session [@cameronfaulkner2020]. Three different types of gestures are shown: hold out and give gestures (`ho_gv`), index-finger pointing (`point`) and reach out gestures (`reach`). Moreover the plot shows the number of gestures at 10 and 12 months.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ngestures %>%\n  filter(months %in% c(10, 12)) %>%\n  drop_na(count) %>%\n  group_by(months, background, gesture) %>%\n  summarise(\n    count_sum = sum(count), .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(as.factor(months), count_sum, fill = background)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  facet_grid(background ~ gesture) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(type = \"qual\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Infant gesture counts (tally) at 10 and 12 mo\",\n    x = \"Months old\", y = \"Gesture count\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ch-viz-principles_files/figure-html/gest-bar-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA bar chart is appropriate with count data, like in this case, but it does not allow for much exploration. Each infant was recorded at 10 and 12 months of age, but in the plot you don't see whether individual infants changed their number of gestures. We can only notice that overall the number of gestures increases from 10 to 12 months old.\n\nWe can use a \"connected point\" plot: each infant is represented by a dot at 10 and 12 months and the dots of the same infant are connected by a line. This allows us to see whether an individual infant uses more gestures at 12 months.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\"}\ngestures %>%\n  filter(months %in% c(10, 12)) %>%\n  drop_na(count) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(as.factor(months), count, colour = background)) +\n  geom_line(aes(group = id), alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  facet_grid(background ~ gesture) +\n  scale_color_brewer(type = \"qual\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Infant gesture counts at 10 and 12 mo\",\n    x = \"Months old\", y = \"Gesture count\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](ch-viz-principles_files/figure-html/gest-line-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou will notice that some infants don't really use more gestures and others even use slightly less gestures. You would not be able to see any of this if you used a bar chart, like we used above.\n\n## Practical tips\n\nHere is a list of practical visualisation tips for you to think about.\n\n::: callout-tip\n1.  Show **raw data** (e.g. individual observations, participants, items...).\n\n2.  Separate data in different **panels** as needed.\n\n3.  Use **simple but informative labels** for axes, panels, etc...\n\n4.  Use colour as a **visual aid**, not just for aesthetics.\n\n5.  **Reuse** labels, colours, shapes throughout different plots to indicate the same thing.\n:::\n",
