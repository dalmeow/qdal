In this chapter you will learn how to create bar charts with ggplot2. We will first create a plot with counts of the number of languages in `global_south` (filtered data from `coretta2022/glot_status.rds`) by their endangerment status and then a plot where we also split the counts by macro-area. To create a bar chart, you use the `geom_bar()` geometry.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Bar charts\n\n**Bar charts** are useful when you are counting things. For example:\n\n-   Number of verbs vs nouns vs adjectives in a corpus.\n\n-   Number of languages by geographic area.\n\n-   Number of correct vs incorrect responses.\n\nThe bar chart geometry is `geom_bar()`.\n:::\n\nRead the `coretta2022/glot_status.rds` data and filter it so that you include only languages from Africa, Australia, Papunesia and South America, with any status except not endangered and extinct.\n\n\n\nIn a simple bar chart, **you only need to specify one axis, the *x*-axis**, in the aesthetics `aes()`. This is because the counts that are placed on the *y*-axis are calculated by the `geom_bar()` function under the hood. This quirk is something that confuses many new learners, so make sure you internalise this. Go ahead and complete the following code to create a bar chart.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglobal_south |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = status)) +\n  ...\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe counting for the *y*-axis is done automatically. R looks in the `status` column and counts how many times each value in the column occurs in the data frame. The counts are then plotted as bars. If you did things correctly, you should get the following plot. The *x*-axis is now `status` and the *y*-axis corresponds to the number of languages by status (`count`).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Number of languages by endangerment status.](ch-more-plotting_files/figure-html/fig-status-bar-1.png){#fig-status-bar width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou could write a description of the plot that goes like this:\n\n> The number of languages in the Global South by endangered status is shown as a bar chart in @fig-status-bar. Among the languages that are endangered, the majority are threatened or shifting.\n\nWhat if we want to show the number of languages by endangerment status within each of the macro-areas that make up the Global South? Easy! You can make a stacked bar chart.\n\n## Stacked bar charts\n\nA special type of bar charts are the so-called stacked bar charts.\n\n::: callout-tip\n#### Stacked bar chart\n\nA **stacked bar chart** is a bar chart in which each bar contains a \"stack\" of shorter bars, each indicating the counts of some sub-groups.\n\nThis type of plot is useful to show how counts of something vary depending on some other grouping (in other words, when you want to count the occurrences of a categorical variable based on another categorical variable). For example:\n\n-   Number of languages by endangerment status, grouped by geographic area.\n\n-   Number of infants by head-turning preference, grouped by first language.\n\n-   Number of past vs non-past verbs, grouped by verb class.\n:::\n\nTo create a stacked bar chart, you just need to add a new aesthetic mapping to `aes()`: `fill`. The `fill` aesthetic lets you fill bars or areas with different colours depending on the values of a specified column. Let's make a plot on language endangerment by macro-area. Complete the following code by specifying that `fill` should be based on `status`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglobal_south |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = Macroarea, ...)) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou should get the following.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Number of languages by macro-area and endangerment status.](ch-more-plotting_files/figure-html/fig-status-stacked-1.png){#fig-status-stacked width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA write-up example:\n\n> @fig-status-stacked shows the number of languages by geographic macro-area, subdivided by endangerment status. Africa, Eurasia and Papunesia have substantially more languages than the other areas.\n\n::: callout-note\n#### Quiz 1\n\nWhat is wrong in the following code?\n\n``` r\ngestures |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = status), fill = Macroarea) +\n  geom_bar()\n```\n:::\n\n## Filled stacked bar charts\n\nIn the plot above it is difficult to assess whether different macro-areas have different proportions of endangerment. This is because the overall number of languages per area differs between areas. A solution to this is to plot **proportions** instead of raw counts. You could calculate the proportions yourself, but there is a quicker way: using the `position` argument in `geom_bar()`. You can plot proportions instead of counts by setting `position = \"fill\"` inside `geom_bar()`, like so:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglobal_south |>\nggplot(aes(x = Macroarea, fill = status)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Proportion of languages by macro-area and endangerment status.](ch-more-plotting_files/figure-html/fig-status-stacked-2-1.png){#fig-status-stacked-2 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe plot now shows proportions of languages by endangerment status for each area separately. Note that the *y*-axis label is still \"count\" but should be \"proportion\". Use `labs()` to change the axes labels and the legend name.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglobal_south |>\nggplot(aes(x = Macroarea, fill = status)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\") +\n  labs(\n    ...\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-tip collapse=\"true\"}\n#### Hint\n\nIf to change the name of the `colour` legend, you use the `colour` argument in `labs()`, guess which argument you should use for `fill`?\n:::\n\nYou should get this.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Proportion of languages by macro-area and endangerment status.](ch-more-plotting_files/figure-html/fig-status-stacked-3-1.png){#fig-status-stacked-3 width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith this plot it is easier to see that different areas have different proportions of endangerment. In writing:\n\n> @fig-status-stacked-3 shows proportions of languages by endangerment status for each macro-area. Australia, South and North America have a substantially higher proportion of extinct languages than the other areas. These areas also have a higher proportion of near extinct languages. On the other hand, Africa has the greatest proportion of non-endangered languages followed by Papunesia and Eurasia, while North and South America are among the areas with the lower proportion, together with Australia which has the lowest.\n\n## Faceting and panels\n\nSometimes we might want to separate the data into separate panels within the same plot. We can achieve that easily using **faceting**. Let's revisit the plots from @sec-plotting. We will use the `winter2012/polite.csv` data again. This is the plot you previously made. Try and reproduce it by writing the code yourself (you also have to read in the data!).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatter plot of mean f0 and H1-H2 difference.](ch-more-plotting_files/figure-html/fig-polite-1.png){#fig-polite width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat looks great, but we want to know if being a music student has an effect on the relationship of `f0mn` and `H1H2`. In the plot above, the aesthetics mappings are the following: `f0mn` on the *x*-axis, `H1H2` on the *y*-axis, `gender` as colour. How can we separate data further depending on whether the participant is a music student or not (`musicstudent`)? We can create panels using `facet_grid()`. This function takes lists of variables to specify panels in rows and/or columns.\n\n**Faceting** a plot allows to split the plot into multiple panels, arranged in rows and columns, based on one or more variables. To facet a plot, use the `facet_grid()` function. The syntax is a bit strange. You can specify rows of panels with the `rows` argument and columns of panels with `cols` argument, but you have to include column names inside `vars()`, like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npolite |>\n  ggplot(aes(f0mn, H1H2, colour = gender)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(musicstudent)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Mean f0 (Hz)\",\n    y = \"H1-H2 difference (dB)\",\n    colour = \"Gender\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scatter plot of mean f0 and H1-H2 difference in non-music students (left) vs music students (right).](ch-more-plotting_files/figure-html/fig-polite-facet-1.png){#fig-polite-facet width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou could write a description of this plot like this:\n\n> @fig-polite-facet shows mean f0 and H1-H2 difference as a scatter plot. The two panels indicate whether the participant was a student of music. Within each panel, the participant's gender is represented by colour (red for female and blue for male). Male participants tend to have higher H1-H2 differences and lower mean f0 than females. From the plot it can also be seen that there is greater variability in H1-H2 difference in female music students compared to female non-music participants. Within each group of gender by music student there does not seem to be any specific relation between mean f0 and H1-H2 difference.\n\nThe `polite` data also has a column `attitude` with values `inf` for informal and `pol` for polite. Subjects were asked to speak either as if they were talking to a friend (`inf` attitude) or to someone with a higher status (`pol` attitude). Recreate the last plot, this time faceting also by `attitude`. Use the `rows` column to create two separate rows for each value of `attitude`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npolite |>\n  ggplot(aes(f0mn, H1H2, colour = gender)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  facet_grid(cols = vars(musicstudent), rows = ...)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-warning\n### Exercise 1\n\nWrite a description for the last plot.\n:::\n\n## Summary\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\"}\n-   Create bar charts with `geom_bar()` to show counts.\n\n-   Use stacked bar charts to show groupings within counts and filled stacked bar charts to show proportions.\n\n-   You can create panels with `facet_grid()`.\n:::\n",
