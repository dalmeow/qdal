# Indexing categorical predictors {#sec-regression-index}

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Area-R-green)

@sec-regression-cat showed you how to fit a regression model with a categorical predictor. We modelled reaction times as a function of word type (real or nonce). The categorical predictor `IsWord` (word type) was coded with so-called treatment contrasts: the model's intercept is the mean of the first level and the "slope" is the difference between the second level and the first.

## Indexing and intercept suppression

$$
\begin{align}
y_i & \sim Gaussian(\mu_i, \sigma)\\
\mu_i & = \beta_{\text{W}[i]}\\
\end{align}

```{r}

rt_idx <- brm(
  RT ~ 0 + IsWord,
